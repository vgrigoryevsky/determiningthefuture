# DeterminingTheFuture


This site is dedicated to gathering and sharing information about the latest developments in understanding, researching, forecasting, modelling, and imagining the future. 

We document [References](references/index.md) to research articles and non-fiction books that explore relevant theories, methodologies, and methods, along with specific implementations such as software programs, libraries, websites, and applications that offer a glimpse into what the future might hold. Additionally, we highlight cultural depictions from sci-fi movies, books, artwork, music, and more.

A separate section of the website is dedicated to cataloging the most advanced ideas, concepts, and megatrends of the future, as they [echo](echo/index.md) to us through the brightest minds of leading researchers and futurists.

In our blog, we strive to interpret these various elements as potential [Pathways to the future](blog/index.md). 

Whether humanity is shaping its own destiny or simply discovering what the future has in store for us, one thing is certain: eventually, we are moving towards each other.
